Okay, wow… just stumbled out of this whirlwind experience, completely, uh, drenched in chaos. Squad 36 is like trying to play a symphony with a rock band—it shouldn’t work, but somehow, it just hits you right in the gut. I’m literally sitting here, like, what did I just watch? Popcorn crumbs all over me and some kid’s sticky soda spill still on my shoe.

> The theater was noisy, so much noise! Like a hundred geese got lost in there. But it didn’t matter 'cause the movie was LOUD. Explosions were just… they were like drums in a jazz concerto. Made my back ache a bit, all tense and stuff, like I’d been headbanging at a garage gig. Did you ever feel a film rattle your ribcage? My ears are still ringing, swear it’s like listening to a punk version of Beethoven’s Fifth.

These characters—wow. Felt like mismatched parts of an orchestra. Lead guy, what was his name? Billy? Or Benny? Anyway, he’s like a trumpet trying to play a violin’s part. And that scene with the car chase—mind you, it felt like it’d been choreographed by a caffeine-crazed squirrel. Just pure, unhinged energy. 

Midway through, I started thinking of my song lyrics for some reason—like how my verses never fit my choruses. Maybe it’s a sign? Dunno. The villain, though! Like a sax solo that goes on just a bit too long but you’re vibing with it, yet begging for a resolution. Need to sit with that performance a bit more.

Someone in the row ahead kept talking about how they couldn’t wait to “download the movie.” I mean, you gotta watch the movie again, right? To catch the bits you missed while trying to stop your brain from running away. Always crazy when you can't tell if you're still in the theater, or if the film followed you out.

Oh! And then the ending, man, it was bananas. Like that weird dream where you're falling and suddenly you're just... eating pancakes? Hah. Wish I could tell you more, but legit, it’s like sand sifting through mental fingers. 

Err, hang on as I try to put words together... brain kinda vibing in like several different time signatures at once. A synesthetic mess, ya know? Anyway, I’ll download the movie next time it’s up; worth another dive for sure.
